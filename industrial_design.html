        <h3>Rustbelt & Glass</h3>
        <p>Rustbelt includes many neighborhoods that once relied on manufacturing business, slowly losing their identities due to manufacturing jobs sourcing oversea. The lack of community identity - an economic replacement attributed to the continuous stagnant economy. The area was suppressed and generation with higher education seemed loath to return. As a result, these towns fell into an infinite cycle of economic depression. In collaboration with Designer Harry Allan and Corning GlassLab, this design - the Warmth reintroduces Rustbelt area. Partnering with Christian Van Luven, the owner of the Syracuse local Roji Tea Lounge, as an attempt to celebrate Chris's effort of rejuvenating the Rustbelt area, and cultivating local businesses, a tea set is designed to support Chris's devotion for tea culture and to emphasize the concept that opening local businesses is a practical solution to the economy of The Rustbelt.

        <p>To develop strategies of re-imagining a new kind of city full of promise and potential. This design aim to use tea as a media to link people's five sense, and provide a complete experience. The business concept of Roji is to provide people with a sense of home feeling. And through this, it allows people to be more adventurous and get comfortable with trying new things. In addition, Roji also offers nightlife without the bar scene, often attracting a packed house and local music. The ideal shape of the cup coincides with the natural glass blowing shape, as it creates the shape similar to a water drop. To serve the purpose of drinking, Cutting the top of the “water drop”, it leaves a flat rim as the cup opening. The concept is that starting from the rim of the water drop shape cup form, it will be covered with white frosted texture. Following the change of contour, frosted white texture will gently fade away. This gradient symbolizes the change of temperature, which shows the stage from frozen to warmness. As for the coaster, the use of concrete gives it a grounded foundation, which help to balance of the lightness of glass cup.
